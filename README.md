This repository includes a large variety of personal projects that I will be creating throughout my learning journey. 

As my knowledge of various languages and topics improves I will be adding new personal projects to the repository.

These projects are NOT a part of my university work and are done in my free time as I become familiar with new concepts and ideas.

I have current interests in game theory, game modding, and machine learning. I will be working towards gaining a strong foundation in as many concepts as I can before I decide to specialise into any particular field.

The creation of new projects has been temporarily placed on hold as my current focus is on learning and understanding Machine Learning so that I can transition to creating a Neural Network for Deep Learning and eventually transitioning into GenAI. I will also be looking at ML application for Data Science and Cybersecurity.
