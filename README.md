This repository includes a large variety of Python projects that I will be coding throughout my BSc Information Technology degree at NWU. 
As my knowledge of various languages and topics improves I will be adding new personal projects to the repository.
These projects are not a part of my university work and are done in my free time as I become familiar with new concepts and ideas.
