When adding new questions to "questions.txt" please follow the below rules:

1. Add each new question on a new line
2. Add the questions in the following format

	question, option1, option2, option3, option4, correct option

3. The commas used are VERY important as they separate the items in the code
4. The correct option should be added as an integer number that corresponds to the number of the correct answer. e.g if option1 is correct then add "1", not the text for option1

There are example questions provided in "questions.txt".
