This repository includes a large variety of perdonal projects that I will be creating throughout my learning journey. 

As my knowledge of various languages and topics improves I will be adding new personal projects to the repository.

These projects are NOT a part of my university work and are done in my free time as I become familiar with new concepts and ideas.

The creation of new projects has been temporarily placed on hold as my current focus is on learning ML so that I can transition through to creating a Neural Network for Deep Learning and eventually transitioning into GenAI.
